A device can optionally be programmed with modem trace prerequisites, making it easy to get started.

1. Connect the device to your computer's USB port.
2. Click **Select Device** on the left-side panel.</br>
   You can view the name and serial number of Nordic Semiconductor devices connected to your computer.
3. Select the device you want to use.</br>
    The options in the left-side panel are updated. See [Overview and user interface](./overview.md).

    You can also view information on the device's connection settings and status in the **Log** view.

4. If your application does not support the Cellular Monitor app's minimal requirements yet, program the required firmare as listed in [software requirements](index.md#software-requirements).
