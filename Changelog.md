    an unsupported database for nRF9151.
-   Issues with the UI layout in the **Certificate Manager** tab.
-   Issue with editing the security tag in the **Certificate Manager** tab,
    which would cause the input to become uneditable when a non-numeric value

### Changed

-   Updated `nrfutil device` to v2.6.4.

    after 5 seconds of starting a trace. The option is only available if
    Wireshark is disabled.
-   Warning in the SidePanel when Wireshark executable is not found.
-   Option to specify path to a Wireshark executable.

### Fixed

-   In some cases, the **Refresh dashboard** button was visible after
    deselecting device.
-   Powering off or deselecting device while tracing, and before receiving any
    packets, would leave the app in a strange state, where it did not look like
    the device was deselected.
-   Programming modem firmware failed if target directory did not exist.

### Changed

-   From **nrf-device-lib-js** to **nrfutil device**, as a backend for
    interacting with devices.

### Added

-   Option to deselect **Terminal Serial Port**.
-   Dashboard field values can be copied by clicking on the value. The value
    will have a blue background when it is possible to copy.
-   Signal quality properties (RSRP, RSRQ, SNR) will show an indication of
    Excellent, Good, Fair, or Bad signal strength when it is available.

### Fixed

-   Programming sample could fail the first time programming an application.
-   Signal quality properties (RSRP, RSRQ, SNR) showed incorrect decibel value
    when it should have shown "Not known or not detectable".

### Changed

-   Renamed **Serial port trace capture** to **Modem trace serial port**.
-   When selected device only exposes one serial port, the app will assume it
    will be used for modem trace. Hence, it will only auto-select serial port
    for the **Modem trace serial port**, and will not select anything for
    **Terminal serial port**.
-   Dashboard card title from Power Saving Mode to Power Saving Features.

## 1.0.2 - 2023-06-15

    easier to notice when a change has been made.
-   Certificate Manager from the Link Monitor app.

    values, but will now show as 'Unknown' until we are able to detect otherwise
    in the trace.
-   The Power Saving Mode value LEGACY PROVIDED PERIODIC TAU was always shown,
    but is now only shown if PROVIDED ACTIVE TIMER is activated, and PROVIDED
    PERIODIC TAU is deactivated and LEGACY PROVIDED PERIODIC TAU is activated.
